Session, Window, And Panes.
![Windows and Pannel](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/f2a2b9f8-d7d9-4ebe-90e8-5551b1c27e99/tmuxnesting.png)

Basically, tmux sessions have windows, and windows have panes. Hereâ€™s how I conceptualize the structure.
Sessions are for an overall theme, such as work, or experimentation, or sysadmin.
Windows are for projects within that theme. So perhaps within your experimentation session you have a window titled noderestapi, and one titled lua sample.
Panes are for views within your current project. So within your sysadmin session, which has a logs window, you may have a few panes for access logs, error logs, and system logs.

### Sessions
```shell
tmux new-session -s [session-nanme]
tmux attach -t [session-name]
tmux kill-session -t [session-name]
```
### Shortcut
These all play off of the ctrl-b shortcut.
